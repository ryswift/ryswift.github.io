            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Channel Muse </p>
            
            <p>Tune into Channel Muse for a glimpse into the local music scene of San Luis Obispo. From underground college students to artists that have graced the stages of our nearby venues, we have that "one song" you recently heard—record, tape, CD, you name it. Stop by for a good time with good music.</p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>Channel Muse is for those who want to branch away from mainstream music and discover the music scene of their hometown of San Luis Obispo. As music has a universal target audience, there is particular focus on the everyday concert-goer or garage band artist, both usually in the younger demographic. This site caters towards the inner indie music snob in all of us.</p>
           
            <p>This site will be just one way a user can support local businesses, while also supporting a local artist in need of engagement. By visting the Channel Muse site, a user can search through our music products, read about local artists, listen to music samples, and overall, get a better idea of what we have to offer to consumers, and the community.  </p>
