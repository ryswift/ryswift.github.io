                    <h2>We are Déjà Brew.</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our story begins in 1994 in the Pacific Northwest coffee capital of the world — Seattle, WA. It was here that founder and owner David Sloan followed his two passions of coffee and art and started Déjà Brew. Our name is clever isn’t it? We offer coffee lovers the freshest cup of brewed coffee and pun lovers a solid laugh for the day. If you're lucky, you'll hear David's infectious laugh that is sure to stick with you.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p> Founder David Sloan met seasoned roaster Steve Smith who had been one of the first roasters ever trained under the three original owners of Starbucks rising through the ranks to being the only roaster at the company to earn the title of Master Roaster. With David’s strong focus on an atmosphere of art and warmth, and Steve’s desire for an artisan approach to roasting, Smith left Starbucks and came to Déjà Brew creating high-quality products for high-quality people. The rest is history.

                            <li>
                                <h4>High-Quality Coffee</h4>
                                <p>We have the utmost respect for this exceptional gift of nature that we have the privilege to enjoy every day. Highly prized, properly roast coffee exists primarily due to traditional methods and a desire to only produce the best of what the coffee world has to offer.</p>
                            </li>
    
                            <li>
                                <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
                                <p>We know there are seemingly endless spots to sip your coffee, but we want to be YOUR spot. Maybe we are your go-to place for when you want to meet a friend or when you’re getting lost in a book...what we can assure you, is that you’ll feel at home.</p>
                            </li>

                                <h4>Art</h4>
                                <p>There is more to someone than what they eat or drink. With that, we want to cultivate creativity by simply giving you something to inspire you. Whether that be a local art showing, a poetry reading, or a gig from a college student, we are here to give you a space to feel, form ideas, and strike up conversation. After all, that is what makes us human.</p>
